# EMSE Systems Lab – Prof. Eric Dano

This private repository is part of the GWU Engineering Management and Systems Engineering (EMSE) department and is used to support lab work, collaborative modeling, and Simcenter Studio integration under the guidance of Prof. Eric Dano.

## Purpose

The repository serves as a centralized workspace to:
- Store and manage SMW files created during lab sessions
- Sync models to GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Convert Simcenter models to YAML and interface with Python tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks)
- Experiment with querying model parameters, running simulations, and more
